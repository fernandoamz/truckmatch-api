# Truckmatch API

## Project Overview

Truckmatch API is a Node.js-based web application that serves as a backend for the Truckmatch service. This API provides features such as user authentication and a GraphQL interface for efficient data requests and manipulations. It is built with Express.js, uses PostgreSQL as the database, and incorporates middleware for handling authentication and CORS.

## Installation

To set up the Truckmatch API locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/truckmatch-api.git
   cd truckmatch-api
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your environment configurations. For example:
   ```
   PORT=5000
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   To start the API, use the following command:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   For development mode:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

Once the API is running, you can access the following endpoints:

- **Base URL:** `http://localhost:5000`
- **Authentication route:** `http://localhost:5000/auth`
- **GraphQL interface:** `http://localhost:5000/graphql` (Access via your browser or a tool like Insomnia/Postman)

The GraphQL interface allows you to interact with your data using queries and mutations. Visit the `/graphql` endpoint to use the interactive GraphiQL interface.

## Features

- User authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- GraphQL API for flexible data handling
- CORS support to allow cross-origin requests
- PostgreSQL as the database for robust data storage
- Middleware for authorization and data verification
